# Porto-Seguro-s-Safe-Driver-Prediction

Creating an embedding network for automatic feature engineering in the Porto Seguroâ€™s Safe Driver Prediction Challenge.
All categorial and ordinal features are embedded and processed along with numeric features for final output.

Network Architecture:

The network is extremely flexible to different number of layers and embeddings. Made in pyTorch.

1)

We put all category column names in a list.
Then we create an embedding layer for each of these depending upon thats feature's unique value count in a loop and store them in the dictionary self.cat_dict
Each embedding layer is saved in the dictionary according to its feature name so it can be retrieved later

2)

We process the remaining numeric features through any number or size of fc layers given by fc_layers argument
This is done in part so thhe number of embeddings dont vastly outnumber numeric features

3)

We then concatonate the embeddings and fc layers and pass through another set of fc layers of any number or size given by merge_layers argument
